*Lesson 3 also*

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initially, a folder \ destination \ etc will not contain any information 
that makes it a true repository, it's just a regular folder like 
everyhting else. Running git init creates a hidden file with the 
meta-data necesasry to make this a .git repository. It doesn not make 
the initial commit (this needs to be done by the user), only the .git 
repository information.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Whereas the working directory is in a constant "as-is" state, the 
staging area holds changes- one or many- without (saving) changing the
 "as-is" nature of the working directory. The staging area holds all
 of the changes to be committed before they become a commit. In this 
 way, it's possible to make more than one change to small working files 
 before makign the more over-arching, logical commit to hold the whole 
 change.
